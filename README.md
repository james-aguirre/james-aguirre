### 💬 About Me
I'm James, a software engineer who specializes in web development but I'm open to learning everything!
I've always had a passion for competetive games whether it's sports, boardgames, or videogames, to me, programming triggers that same passion;
You can always find new ways to better yourself as a programmer, whether its writing clean code, applying new technologies or finding creative solutions to challenging problems. When I'm not writing code or studying I enjoy lifting weights and spending time with friends and family.

- 📖 Currently studying -  Tailwind, NextJS, TypeScript
- ⌨️ Currently working on - Currently rebuilding AnimeList in nextjs13
- 🌎 Always open to new opportunities!

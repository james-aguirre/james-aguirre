### 💬 About Me
I'm James, a web developer who specializes in JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, HTML5, CSS3 and more but I'm open to learning anything!
I've always had a passion for competetive games whether it's sports, boardgames, or videogames, to me, programming triggers that same passion;
You can always find new ways to better yourself as a programmer, whether its writing clean code, applying new technologies or finding a creative
solution to a problem that was once challenging. When I'm not writing code or studying I enjoy lifting weights and spending time with friends and family.
